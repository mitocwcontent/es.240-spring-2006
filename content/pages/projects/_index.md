Project Description
-------------------

Over the course of several weeks, students met individually with the instructors, and in small groups outside of class to develop and refine their projects. Students then presented their projects in a two-week, end-of-term exhibition of their work. The final project served several important functions. First, it gave students a focus for their in-class work; students did the in-class exercises with the awareness that materials generated from those exercises might become elements of their final projects. This helped to give an over-arching shape to the class, and tied each class assignment to a greater goal. Second, for final projects, students were asked to choose a particular aspect of their lives that they wished to express to others. Students were required to be self-expressive in a way that clearly presented their ideas to others. In preparing work for the exhibition, students considered how their work would be perceived by an audience and how to be articulate in presenting their ideas. The projects shown below are merely a representative sampling of some of the approaches students took to their final projects.
